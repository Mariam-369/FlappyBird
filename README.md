# FlappyBird
A basic simulation of the game 'Flappy Bird' using OpenGL.

In this simplified version of the game, the only button you need to press on is 'f' to move the bird, 
and you need to survive 3 randomized sets of 9 borders (3 on top and 3 at the bottom) to win the game.
The mushroom is a powerup that allows you to collide with the barriers without losing a life, but the
powerup's effect is over as soon as the next set appears.
